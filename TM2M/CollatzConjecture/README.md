# Collatz Conjecture

This is the code for a two-talk series I gave for Talk Math 2 Me at Lake Superior State University. In this folder, you'll find a few different files.

-Dumb Collatz

This is the brute force solution for the problem

-Smart Collatz

This is the solution that uses the faster technique we talked about

-Bonus

This folder has some other little goodies. It has a program you can use to generate the Collatz chain for any number you want! There's also a separate length program you can play around with too.

Enjoy!
