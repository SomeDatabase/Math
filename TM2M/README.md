# Talk Math 2 Me

Talk Math 2 Me is a program that began at Texas State University, and has recently been brought to Lake Superior State University. It's a student seminar where students, regardless of their major, pick something math-related to talk about. It gives them extra public speaking experience, and allows them to explore math in new ways. 

This repository was created for a two-talk series I gave, on using algorithms to find Collatz Chain lengths. If I do more talks in the future (which I hope to) I'll upload those here.
