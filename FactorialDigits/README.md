# Factorial Digit Length

A few days ago, I solved [Project Euler Problem 20](https://github.com/SomeDatabase/ProjectEuler/blob/master/Problem20/Problem20.py) which asks for the [sum of the digits in 100!](https://projecteuler.net/problem=20). I was later telling one of my professors about this problem (because considering how massive 100! is, I would have expected the sum of the digits to be a lot bigger). As we talked about the problem, we both became interested in how many digits are in 100!.

This is a Python solution I wrote. The code, while slightly ugly, is fairly simple. The user enters a number. Then, Python converts it to an integer, and counts the number of digits. I'm not sure how well this actually works, but I did verify it works for 100!, 1000!, and 10000! factorial. I'm not sure how high you can go without getting a number error, but I'd hope it runs for all the integers in between. If you have any issues, you know what to do.
