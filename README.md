# Math
I'm a wannabe mathematician who writes code to do fun math things. This repo is kind of a mess, but you can generally expect me to have things like...

-Problem Simulations
-Code for my Talk Math 2 Me talks
-Code from (past) math problems

Please not that you will not find my Project Euler solutions here, unless I talk about them for Talk Math 2 Me (in which case the solutions will probably be modified before being uploaded into here). If you'd like to see those, you can go [here](https://github.com/SomeDatabase/ProjectEuler). Otherwise, enjoy.

I will probably update this with some sort of index so you don't get lost.
